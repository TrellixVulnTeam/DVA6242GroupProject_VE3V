In all my years of renting this is the first time an inspection included lifting up carpet and implying it was a pet mess!!!! It's funny because how do I know they weren't there before? They never showed me the under carpet prior to moving in. There was a huge patch in the middle of the carpet that came up a couple weeks after we moved in so obviously it wasn't new carpet. My dogs were very well house and crate trained. Once again another beware for ALL RENTERS!!", "Nice spacious apartment....terrible managent", "I have lived all over the country and this is the ONLY complex where the manager cares what's going on. I've lived here 6 years now and don't ever plan on leaving! The maintenance staff has had a lot of issues, but the manager will make sure your problem is taken care of. I'm so glad she enforces the rules - I don't have to worry about riff-raff moving in and ruining our wonderful community.", "Very nice building with great amenities. Excellent staff. Have lived here for 7 years and have a nice 2 bedroom with a beautiful terrace. There's a crunch gym, an Anthem gym, a beautifully landscaped roof with lounge chairs and spectacular views. There's a rec room with a TV and pool table and there is complimentary breakfast served there 5 days a week.", "I moved to my apartment when I was pregnant with my daughter who is now 25 years old! This apartment has seen a lot of life's changes and challenges but signifies home for us. Facing west with large bay windows I've observed truly magnificent sunsets in Manhattan! Summer has a resort feel here on the east river. My apartment is somewhat oversized by NYC standards and remains below market rate and for that I am grateful!", "After living 5 years and paying almost half of my son loan to Waterside plaza for rent and a lot of challenges on that place . Almost 2 months passed and still we don't have our security deposit back. Very unorganized and they are not responding my phone.", "Windsor court is apartment living at its finest. The building and apartments are beautiful. I love my granite kitchen and bathroom. Laundry on every floor is great. The staff and doormen are friendly and helpful. Its in a great location in the heart of Murray Hill, just a few blocks from the 6 train.", "A HORRIBLE place to live. Save yourself a lot of money and time and look ELSEWHERE. - a former 1-yr resident of this horrendous and toxic place", "I live in a very luxurious apartment building on the east side of Manhattan. Settled right in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of young professionals, bars, restaurants, grocery stores, and more. A quick walk to the east river, it is a great place to live! My current apartment building has a Doorman, Elevator, Gym, Roof, Laundry, Dry Cleaning Service and many more amenities that you can't find anywhere else."]
